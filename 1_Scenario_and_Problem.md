1.0 Scenario and Problem:

A delivery company operates a fleet of vehicles to deliver packages to
various locations within a city. The company needs to schedule
deliveries from a central warehouse to multiple destinations, each
with specific time windows during which the delivery must be made.
Each vehicle has a maximum capacity and incurs operating costs
based on distance travelled and time spent.

The road network in the city is well-defined, with known distances and
travel times between locations. The company aims to minimize the
overall delivery time and cost while ensuring all deliveries are made
within the given time constraints.

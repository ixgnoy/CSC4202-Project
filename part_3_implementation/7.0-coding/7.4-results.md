The output of the program should be intuitive enough to understand. It contains a summary of each delivery operation - from where it started, where it ended, the path taken, the distance traveled, and the weight of the order.
    1. The first line shows the order in which deliveries were made. Starting from vertex 0 (which could be the restaurant), the deliveries were made in order to vertices 1, 2, and 3. "No more location to visit" means all orders have been delivered.
    2. The rest of the codes are a brief description of each route: the path it is taking and the total distance of the path, as well as the weight of the order to ensure that the program makes no mistake in determining which order to be delivered first.

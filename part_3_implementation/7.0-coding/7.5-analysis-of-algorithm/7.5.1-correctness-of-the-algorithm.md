<h2>7.5.1 Correctness of the Algorithm</h2>

Tracing the output of each possible input is impossible. This is why the correctness of an algorithm is important.

To prove the correctness of our particular algorithm, we will use loop invariant.

The loop invariant must be true:
- before the loop starts
- before each iteration of the loop
- after the loop terminates
  
Since we are dealing with Dijkstra's algorithm, let us focus on the dijkstra() method:
```java
static void dijkstra(double[][] graph, int src, int dest) {
        int V = graph.length;
        double[] distances = new double[V];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[V];
        parents = new int[V];

        for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) {
            distances[i] = INFINITY;
            visited[i] = false;
            parents[i] = NO_PARENT; // Initialize all parents to -1
        }

        distances[src] = 0;

        for (int count = 0; count < V; count++) {
            int u = findNextNode(distances, visited);

            visited[u] = true;

            for (int v = 0; v < V; v++) {
                if (!visited[v] && graph[u][v] != 0 &&
                        (distances[u] + graph[u][v] < distances[v])) {
                    parents[v] = u;
                    distances[v] = distances[u] + graph[u][v];
                }
            }
        }

        printSolution(src, dest, distances, parents);
    }
```
Dijkstra's algorithm consists of two main loops: the outer loop iterates over all the vertices, and the inner loop explores the neighbors of each vertex to update the distances. The inner loop is responsible for updating the distances, while the outer loop determines the order in which the vertices are processed.


Loop Invariant Condition:

At the start of each iteration of the main loop, for each vertex v, distances[v]is the weight of a shortest path from the source to v that only uses vertices in the set {v: visited[v] == true} (the set of all visited vertices), and parents[v] is the last edge on that path.

Initialization:

Before the loop starts, the distances array is set to INFINITY for all vertices, except for the source vertex which is set to 0, meaning that there is no path from source to any vertex, which is consistent with our Loop Invariant condition. Similarly, the parents array is set to -1 for all vertices, indicating there's no known path yet from source to any vertex.

Maintenance:

During the loop, when a vertex v is chosen and visited, the distances for all its neighboring vertices w that are not visited yet are updated if a shorter path is found through v. This means that for every vertex w, distances[w] is the weight of the shortest path found so far that only uses vertices in the visited set, and parents[w] is the last edge on that path. Hence, the loop invariant holds after each iteration.

Termination:

When the loop terminates, all vertices have been visited, meaning that the shortest path from the source to every other vertex has been found and stored in the distances array. The Loop Invariant at termination also gives us the correctness of Dijkstra's algorithm: For every vertex v, distances[v] is the weight of the shortest path from the source to v, and parents[v] is the last edge on that path.

Hence, the given algorithm is correct as per the concept of Loop Invariant. It correctly implements Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path between any two vertices in a graph.

<h2>7.2 Algorithm Descriptions</h2>

<h3>Classes and their Functions</h3>

Graph:

This class defines a graph with vertices (restaurants and customers' homes) and edges (paths from restaurant to customers' homes and vice versa).

Functions:

- Graph(int v): Initializes the graph with a given number of vertices.
- addEdge(int v, int dest, double weight): Adds an edge between two vertices along with its weight.
- removeEdge(int v, int dest): Removes an edge between two vertices.
- getMaxPriority(String[] foodItems): Returns the maximum priority among the given food items. -Different types of food have different priorities.
- getAdjacencyMatrix(): Returns a matrix representing the adjacency of all vertices in the graph.
- getSortedOrders(String filename): Reads orders from a file, assigns weights to each order based on their distance and priority, sorts the orders, and returns them as a List.
- calculateWeight(double distance, double maxPriorityValue): Calculates the weight of an order based on the distance and the priority of the food items in the order.

  
DijkstrasAlgorithm:

This class contains methods to find the shortest path between vertices of a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Functions:

- findNextNode(double[] distances, boolean[] visited): Finds the next node to visit based on the shortest distance and whether it's been visited or not.
- dijkstra(double[][] graph, int src, int dest): Computes the shortest path between the source and destination vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- printSolution(int startVertex, int endVertex, double[] distances, int[] parents): Prints the shortest path from start vertex to end vertex.
- printPath(int currentVertex, int[] parents): Recursively prints the path from source vertex to current vertex.
- deliverOrder(int source, int destination, Graph graph): Delivers an order from the source to the destination using the shortest path calculated by Dijkstra's algorithm.

Time to shine!

How to Use?

Don't worry, we going to guide you here:

To run the program, create a Graph instance by passing the total number of vertices (totalVertices) to the Graph constructor. Then, read the orders from the order file, add the edges between the vertices based on the orders, and deliver the orders using the deliverOrder function. This function will automatically calculate the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm and deliver the order along this path.

The orders file should be in the following format: <source vertex> <destination vertex> <displacement> <distance> <food items>. 
<h4>The food items should be separated by commas without spaces.</h4>

<h2>4.3 Best Travelling Route</h2>

After determining food order prioritization, the algorithm identifies the most efficient delivery route. It prioritizes the shortest paths between destinations within the established order. To achieve this, the algorithm keeps track of distances between all potential connections. By comparing these distances, it can evaluate and select the optimal route that minimizes overall delivery time. 

No worries, we will discuss the detailed implementation of the algorithm in subsequent section.

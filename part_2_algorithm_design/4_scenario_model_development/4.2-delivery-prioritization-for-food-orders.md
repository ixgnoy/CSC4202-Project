<h2>4.2 Delivery Prioritization for Food Orders</h2>

The process of determining food order prioritization hinges on the number of deliveries assigned to a driver at once.  For single deliveries, the driver can proceed directly to the destination. However, when drivers manage multiple orders with varying locations, a systematic approach is necessary to sequence deliveries effectively. This prioritization considers two key factors: delivery distance and food content.

Distance forms the first layer of our food order prioritization strategy. We prioritize deliveries based on the shortest travel distance between the starting point (typically the restaurant or shop) and each destination. This approach focuses on identifying the closest food order, regardless of a perfectly direct route. By prioritizing proximity, we ensure efficient delivery execution and timely order fulfillment.

Distance forms the foundation, but food content adds another layer to our prioritization strategy. We consider the remaining shelf life of food items, prioritizing those with a shorter lifespan. For instance, cold coffee would be prioritized over fried chicken, and ice cream would take precedence over cold coffee. To quantify this, we assign priority values between 0 and 1 to each food category based on their remaining shelf life. These values reflect the level of attention required during delivery sequence determination.

However, the scenario can become more complex in certain cases. When the driver receives multiple food orders with the exact same combinations of food items, the food contents factor does not play a role in prioritization. In such cases, distance becomes the sole factor affecting the delivery prioritization. This raises the challenge of finding the right balance between distance and food contents factors. In addition, how to determine the prioritization if a food order consists of food items of different food categories, each with different priority value?

To address these complexities, we implement a weight formula that assigns a weight value to each food order. This value considers both the delivery distance and the priority value of the food items within the order. Essentially, the weight value reflects the overall importance and prioritization of the delivery. Orders with lower weight values are delivered first, followed by those with progressively higher weight values.

If all food orders contain the exact same combinations of food items, the priority value for all food items is assumed to be 0, and the weight value depends solely on the distance factor. On the other hand, if a food order consists of multiple food categories with different priority values, the maximum priority value among them is used to calculate the weight value of a food order. This approach ensures that the food item with the highest priority value in a food order is efficiently considered when determining the overall priority of the food order. In certain cases, the priority value of the food items can outweigh the distance factor, particularly when there are significant differences in the priority values between food orders. This will be further elaborated in the subsequent section.

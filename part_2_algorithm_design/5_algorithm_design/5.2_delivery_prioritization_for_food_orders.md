<h2>5.2 Delivery Prioritization for Food Orders</h2>

For single deliveries, the driver proceeds directly to the destination. However, for multiple orders, the weight value, calculated using a specific formula that considers both distance and food quality, dictates the delivery sequence. Deliveries begin with the destination associated with the lowest weight value, ensuring time-sensitive orders are prioritized.

The weight value is calculated using the formula:

To ensure food freshness, each food item is assigned a priority value between 0 and 1 based on its category.  Items with shorter shelf life (e.g., salads, desserts) receive higher priority values,  indicating they should be delivered first. This system ensures perishable items are prioritized during the delivery process.

While distance is the primary factor in weight calculation (encompassing fuel costs and overall efficiency), food quality takes precedence in specific scenarios. This occurs when multiple orders have similar travel distances but different food items. In such cases, the order with a higher priority value (indicating shorter shelf life) is prioritized for delivery. By balancing distance and priority value, the algorithm optimizes delivery decisions, ensuring a balance between efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The following are the food categories along with their associated priority values:

<table>
  <caption>Food Category Priority Values</caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Food Category</th>
      <th>Priority Value</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cooked Food</td>
      <td>0.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Cold / Hot Drinks</td>
      <td>0.5</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Dessert</td>
      <td>0.8</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

When drivers receive multiple orders with identical food item combinations, all priority values are assumed to be 0. Consequently, distance becomes the sole factor influencing weight calculation, as no food item requires prioritization over others.  However, for orders with different food item combinations, each item receives a priority value based on its category. The highest priority value within an order is then used to calculate its weight value. Deliveries prioritize orders with lower weight values (closer distance or lower priority), ensuring perishable items are delivered first.

1. If the driver receives a single food order, proceed with delivering that order.
2. If the driver receives multiple food orders with identical combinations of food items, assume all food items have a priority value of 0, and proceed to step 5.
3. If each order consists of a different combination of food items, proceed to step 4.
4. For every order, assign a priority value to each food item. Select the maximum priority value among food items as the food order's priority value.
5. Calculate the weight value for each food order using the provided formula.
6. Start delivering the food order with the lowest weight value, followed by other food orders in ascending weight value.

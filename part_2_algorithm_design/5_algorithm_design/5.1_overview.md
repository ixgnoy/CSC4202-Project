<h2>5.1 Overview</h2>

The optimized delivery route algorithm consists of two main parts: 
- determining the delivery prioritization of food orders
-  finding the best travelling route based on these orders.

Delivery prioritization is carried out considering distance and food item priority. The second part involves implementing the Dijkstra algorithm to find the best route based on the determined delivery prioritization.

We model the delivery scenario as a weighted graph. Nodes represent the starting point and delivery destinations, while edges connecting them represent travel paths. Edges directly connecting the starting point to a destination are labeled with the food order's weight value, calculated using a formula that considers both distance and food quality. Edges connecting two destinations simply have the distance as their weight. This weight value is crucial for both prioritizing deliveries and finding the most efficient overall route. It's important to note that not all destinations may have direct paths from the starting point. In such cases, the shortest possible distance is used for the weight calculation. The key points for this graph representation are summarized below.

1. Node represents the starting point and delivery destinations.
2. Edge represents the travelling path.
3. If there’s a connected path (edge) between starting point and destination, the distance of path is used to calculate food order’s weight value. Label the edge with this weight value.
4. If there’s a connected path between destinations, label this edge with the distance of path.
5. Else if there’s no direct path between the starting point and destination, the distance used for calculating weight value is the distance on map.
   
Leveraging Dijkstra's Algorithm for Optimal Routes:

Once delivery priorities are established, the algorithm employs Dijkstra's algorithm to identify the most efficient route. This algorithm starts from the destination with the lowest weight value (considering both distance and food quality) and strategically sequences deliveries to minimize overall travel time. This approach ensures optimal efficiency and prioritizes customer satisfaction by delivering the most time-sensitive orders first.

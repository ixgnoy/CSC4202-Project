<h2>5.3 Best Travelling Route</h2>

Following prioritization, the Dijkstra algorithm takes center stage to identify the most efficient delivery route. As the driver progresses through the prioritized order, they'll select the path with the shortest distance to the next destination. Here, edge weights directly correspond to travel distances between destinations. Therefore, choosing the path with the lowest weight value ensures the driver travels the shortest distance possible. By adhering to this method, the driver navigates the route efficiently, minimizing travel time and ensuring timely deliveries.

The Dijkstra algorithm can determine the best route with minimal weight. Below listed the pseudocode for implementing Dijkstra:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
1. Create an empty set called "visited" to keep track of the visited nodes.

2. Create a list called "weights" to store the weights from the starting point to each destination. Initialize all weights to infinity except for the starting point, which is set to 0.

3. Create a list called "destinations" to store the destinations to be visited in determined delivery prioritization.

4. While there are unvisited destinations:
     4.1. Choose the next destination from the "destinations" list, which is not already visited. Let's call this destination "current".
     4.2  Add "current" to the "visited" set.
     4.3  For each neighbour of "current" that is not in the "visited" set:
           4.3.1 Calculate the tentative weight from the starting point to the neighbour through "current". This weight is the sum of the weight from the edges from starting point to "current" and the neighbour.
           4.3.2 If the tentative weight is less than the current weight stored in the "weights" list for the neighbour, update the weights to the tentative weight.
        
5.	Return the "weights" list, which now contains the best route from the starting point to each destination, following the determined delivery order.

The above figure displays an example of the representation of the scenario in the form of a weighted graph. Since Dijkstra algorithm always prefers paths with lower weight, there is a need to identify the weight of all edges using the following algorithm:

1. The edge connects starting point and food order destination. The edge is labelled with the weight value of the food order.
2. The edge connects different destinations. The edge is labelled with the distance as its weight.
3. No edge (path) connects starting point and food order destination. However, the weight formula requires a distance value. Thus, take the shortest distance of unconnected path between them to be used in weight value calculation.

Having assigned weights to all connections (edges) in the graph, Dijkstra's algorithm steps in to identify the optimal delivery route. It calculates the shortest path from the starting point (restaurant) to each destination, adhering to the established delivery order.  During travel, the driver prioritizes the shortest paths between destinations. This translates to selecting the edge with the lowest weight value, signifying the shortest distance between locations. A more detailed explanation of the graph structure and the algorithm steps will be provided in the following section.

<h3>2.0 Importance of Optimal Solution</h3>

Finding an optimal solution for this food delivery algorithm is crucial for several reasons:

1. Driver Efficiency and Regulations:
Description: Truck drivers have legal limitations on their working hours. In this scenario, we've set a maximum of 10 hours.
Importance: An optimal algorithm ensures delivery routes are planned within these limitations. This prevents driver fatigue, promotes safety, and complies with regulations.

2. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:
Description: Customers expect fast and reliable delivery. Here, we aim to deliver packages within 10 hours of them being sent out.
Importance: An optimal algorithm minimizes delivery time by finding the most efficient routes. This leads to faster deliveries, exceeding customer expectations and boosting satisfaction.
